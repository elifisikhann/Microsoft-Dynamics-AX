# Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a process used by companies to manage and integrate the important parts of their businesses.

Without an ERP application, each department would have its system optimized for its specific tasks. 

With ERP software, each department still has its system, but all of the systems can be accessed through one application with one interface.

Some benefits of ERP include the free flow of communication between business areas, a single source of information, and accurate, real-time data reporting.

An ERP software system can also integrate planning, purchasing inventory, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and more.
