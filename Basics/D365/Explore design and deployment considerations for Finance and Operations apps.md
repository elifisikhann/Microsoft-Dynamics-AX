## Explore design and deployment considerations for Finance and Operations apps

### Finance and Operations apps frameworks

Finance and Operations apps allow you to use Task recorder and Business process modeler (BPM) to create user acceptance test libraries.

#### Task recorder

The Task recorder tool can be used to create multiple, in-depth, walk through recordings of business processes in Finance and Operations apps that can be used in various scenarios. 

Use with the **Regression Suite Automation Tool (RSAT)** for regression testing scenarios and to share with other business users to ensure continuity across roles in the system.

#### Business process modeler

The Business process modeler (BPM) can also be used to create user acceptance test libraries; you can create, view, and modify repeatable implementations that are based on libraries and flowcharts. BPM helps align the business processes for Finance and Operations with industry standard processes. 

#### Data management framework

The Data management framework can be used to manage data entity packages in Finance and Operations apps. It uses a series of concepts to enable you to set up and copy configuration for new implementations, which can help even if your team doesn't understand the structure of data or dependencies, and can lead to an easier implementation.
